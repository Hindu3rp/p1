<p>HTML is made up of markup symbols, or codes, that are inserted into a file to tell a web browser how to display the page's content. These codes are written between angle brackets, and are called elements or tags. For example, the <img> and <input> tags introduce content directly into the page, while the  tags surround and provide information about the text.
